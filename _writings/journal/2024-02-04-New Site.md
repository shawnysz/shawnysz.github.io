At the beginning of this year, I set a few goals for myself—part practical, part personal.
 One of them was to rebuild my life from the inside out: getting LASIK after wearing glasses for most of my life, adjusting my diet, moving again, sleeping well, and caring less about how others perceive me. Limiting social posting was part of that reset.

I also wanted a place to express myself, and at the same time, a space where people can see what I’m working on.
 This site serves that purpose.

Here, I’ll write about the things I’m building and thinking about—without performance, without PR language. Direct writing says more than any curated bio.

Maintaining a site isn’t effortless, but writing regularly helps me see how I change over time. That alone is valuable.
