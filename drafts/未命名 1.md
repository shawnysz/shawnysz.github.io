Desire often feels better than ownership.

It took me a long time to realize I actually like Fridays more than Saturdays. Friday is the full anticipation with a taste of reward (Fri night), Satuday is all reward and knowing that the weekend won't go on forever.

Star Trek also has an incredibly similar quote in it.

After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true.

Plus delaying ownership increases desires and prolong better feeling. Win win if you can hold to it.

  

All the more reason to lease rather than buy if you know you're going to be swapping out constantly.
