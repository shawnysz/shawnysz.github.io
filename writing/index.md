# Writing
<a class="subtitle" href="/">By Shawn Zhou</a>

I draft ideas in small bursts before refining them into essays and letters here. Most pieces orbit the intersection of spatial systems, software tooling, and independent practice.

A slower publishing cadence means new work arrives a few times a year, but every post is a deliberate dispatch. Check back once in a while if you want to follow along.
