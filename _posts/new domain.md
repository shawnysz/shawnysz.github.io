just bought this [domain](shawnyzhou.com) and looking forward to jornaling or writing something.

doesn't like all those "new life" kind but i figured this might be a better way to record my thoughts over time better than an instagram story/post.

a few things in my mind for now

- change my personal email to a set of new domain email address
- organize a few topics for future posts
- no photos will be hosted on this site

maybe i will have an individual post on how to set up this site and how to pick the services i use, and why
