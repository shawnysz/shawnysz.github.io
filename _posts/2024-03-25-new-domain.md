i don't like all those "new life" or "new start" type of things but i figured jornaling or writing something consistanly and reguarly might be a better way to keep a record of my thought process over time and i would be suprised over time for what my thoughts gonna change.

also, writing is the best way to organize and clear thoughts and ideas, and eventually lead to better ideas. 

two things i want to do for myself

- set topics for all future posts
- format is text-only
