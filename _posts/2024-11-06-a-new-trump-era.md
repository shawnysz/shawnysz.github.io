It’s been a long time since I stayed up late, but a new era is dawning and I want to witness.

Trump won, and it was a quick and "clear" win this time. 

I'm surprised by how those dramas happened on the national televisions, newspapers, assassins, burned mailboxes, fake ID and even no ID voting, duplicate votes, celebrity endorsements,  awkward debates and interviews of Harris... jaw dropping. And for people who still hate Trump, think about this - "if you lose the senate, house, electoral college AND popular vote, and you think the lesson is half the country is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and stupid…" wrong lesson and the same thing will likely happen again in 2028.

New media is destroying the legacy media, now.
