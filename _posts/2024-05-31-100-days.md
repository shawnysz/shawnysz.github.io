Today, I marked my 100th day free from smoking and drinking, and, I feel great. 

It's been a journey back to health, especially after years where I didn't take good care of myself. I used to find comfort in smoking and drinking, especially when stressed, but it took a toll on my body. My decision to quit wasn't sudden; it came from slowly realizing the damage I was doing. 

Now, I don't have the sore throat anymore, my body feels lighter, and I have more time to do things I enjoy instead of feeling hungover. I've even lost about 30 pounds. 

Looking back at these past three months, it's clear how much change can happen in a short time. If there’s something troubling you, why not try giving it up for 100 days? You might be surprised by the difference it makes. So, if you’re thinking about making a change, just start, the rest will follow, and you never know how much better you might feel.
