at the beginning of this year, i set myself some goals to finish for this year (including my birthday wishes too)

one of those goals is to rebuild myself: do the lasik to get rid of the glasses for nearly all of my adult & teenage & child life; change my diet; get back to workout, or at least start moving my body; get quality sleep every night etc. and also, stop caring about how people are thinking about me (by limiting my self posting on social apps)

but at the same time, i want to leave a door for people who want to know me, quick and efficient, which save me time to repeatedly talking about "me" 

so i want this site to be a place that i can post something i'm interested and express some part of my thinkings/feelings/emotions. 

leave out all those "re-introduction"

after all, some writing directly from the person, will have more credibility than an official PR nowadays

keep updating the site is not easy, i get it. but i also believe by writing something regularly, i can observe the change of myself on stuffs, and would be much valuable for my personal growth, making me a better person 

hopefully, i can continue to update

you can subscribe by rss for this site, by not need to visit this site "every single day" :)

also, you can try search to find something maybe you would interested? maybe?
