# What I Use
<a class="subtitle" href="/">By Shawn Zhou</a>

Daily work lives on a 14" MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip, paired with an iPad mini for reading, sketching, and quick markups when traveling between studios.

Figma, Rhino, Shapr3D, and lightweight code editors handle most of the design stack, while Notion and Obsidian keep shared systems and private links organized.

Analog tools still matter: a Traveler’s Notebook, Muji pens, a Leica Q for documentation, and a rotation of vintage-inspired watches when I want to slow down.
