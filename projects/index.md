<a class="subtitle" href="/">By Shawn Zhou</a>

Field Lab documents the adaptive workplace experiments I run with collaborators across architecture, fabrication, and software. Each cycle explores how physical systems can remain flexible without feeling temporary.

Neighborhood Residences expands that thinking into multi-building housing concepts focused on daylight, shared courtyards, and modular construction strategies that feel human instead of generic.

Systems Atlas is my research map for how public space, policy, and tooling overlap. It mixes fieldwork, diagrams, and software notes to show how civic projects evolve from sketches into lived infrastructure.
