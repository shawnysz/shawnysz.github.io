# Collections
<a class="subtitle" href="/">By Shawn Zhou</a>

Tools, devices, clothing, and everyday objects I rely on. Not a shopping list — a record of what works for me and why. I update this page as my workflow, style, and habits evolve.

## Devices
Daily work lives on a 14" MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip, paired with an iPad mini for reading, sketching, and quick markups while moving between studios. An iPhone 15 Pro handles documentation when the Leica stays home.

## Software
Figma, Rhino, Shapr3D, and lightweight code editors cover design and modeling. Notion and Obsidian hold shared systems and private research links, while Things keeps active tasks grounded.

## Clothing
Studio days rotate through engineered garments, wide trousers, and lightweight jackets that can handle bikes, job sites, and dinners without changing fits. Footwear alternates between Salomon trail shoes and worn-in derby boots.

## EDC
Traveler’s Notebook inserts, Muji gel pens, and a Leica Q stay in the bag alongside a compact tape measure, a pocket-sized screwdriver kit, and a brass key organizer.

## Workspace
Most work happens on a standing-height drafting table with a matte monitor, soft task lighting, and modular shelving for samples. Portable rolling cases keep material swatches and electronics ready for site visits.

## Wine & Watches
A rotating selection of Rhône reds and Jura whites split time with natural-leaning bottles from small producers. Watches bounce between a Tudor Black Bay, a Seiko GMT for travel, and a vintage-inspired chronograph when I want to slow down.
