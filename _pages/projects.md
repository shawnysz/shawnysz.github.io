i'm into lots of stuff - more as a what i want to do than trying to turn it into something that i will escape from

- this site, trying to update regularly
- a development company by me and my team
- a construction service by me and my team
- a residential building development
- a fabrication shop for making objects we want to make, glass/metal/wood/concrete through CNC/ 3D-Printing/ laser cutting
- a personal server
- being a more sophisticated basketball player to play for full court without leg cramp :)
- finishing a full marathon in a *foreseeable* future, to travel to different cities for the marathon as one goal for visiting different places
- a collection of watches, unique & rare
- a drinking experience of good wines

come on, it's never a bad thing to have too many hobbies, right?
