I'm shawn zhou, living in New York City.

I spend most of my time with artists, architects, designers, entrepreneurs and different people on creating better spaces for people to live, work and relax.

I enjoy reading, watching movies, listening to music, hanging out with friends, and endlessly talking about crazy ideas. also i love watching [sports](https://www.shawnyzhou.com/sports). sometimes i drink some good wines or whiskeys (but majorly burgundy red/white )

On a random Sunday, you may see me walking in the city, or playing basketball, or playing video games at my office.

if you are interested, check out some [projects](https://shawnyzhou.com/projects) I'm working on;

and, a short [microblog](https://public.me/shawn) for some quick takes and random bits;

and, my [instagram](https://instagram.com/shawnyzhou), i only post stories, sometimes very frequently ;)
