I'm shawn, living in New York City.

I spend most of my time with artists, architects, designers, entrepreneurs and different people on creating better spaces for people to live, work and relax.

I enjoy reading, watching movies, listening to music, hanging out with friends, and talking about crazy ideas. also i love watching [sports](https://www.shawnyzhou.com/sports). sometimes i drink some wines/whiskeys.

On a random Sunday, you may see me walking in the city, or playing basketball, or playing video games.
