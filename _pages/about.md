---
i'm shawn, currently living in New York City.

i spend most of my time with artists, architects, designers, entrepreneurs and different people on creating better spaces for people to live, work and relax.

i enjoy reading, watching a great movie, listening to a great song, hanging out with friends, and talking about crazy ideas. also i love sports. 

on a random sunday, you may see me walking in the city, or playing basketball, or playing video games.
