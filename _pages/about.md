Hey, I'm Shawn, currently living in New York City.

As a real estate developer and a general contractor, I spend most of my time with artists, architects, designers, entrepreneurs and different people on creating better spaces for people to live, work and relax.

I enjoy reading, watching a great movie, listening to a great song, hanging out with friends, and talking about crazy ideas.

On a random Sunday, you may see me walking around in the city or playing basketball, or playing video games.
