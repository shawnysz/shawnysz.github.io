Hey, I'm Shawn Zhou, currently live in New York City.

As a developer and a general contractor, I spend most of my time with artists, architects, designers, entrepreneurs and different people on creating better spaces for people to live, work and relax.

I enjoy reading, hanging out with friends, and talking about strange ideas.

On a random Sunday, you may see me walking around in the city or playing basketball.
