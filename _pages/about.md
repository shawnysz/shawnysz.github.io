Hey, I'm Shawn Zhou, currently live in New York City.

"Build to make dream come ture" is what makes me wake up every morning.

As a developer and a general contractor, I spend most of my time with friends, artists, architects, designers, entrepreneurs and different people on creating better spaces for people to live, work and relax.

I enjoy reading, hanging out with friends, and talking about strange ideas.

On a normal Sunday, I would chosse to walk around in the city or playing basketball in the parks.
