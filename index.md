description: "Systems, essays, journal entries, projects, and tools by Shawn Zhou."
---

I work across spaces, systems, and ideas — shifting between physical and digital projects depending on what needs to be built. I keep a record of the things I’m exploring in my [projects](/projects), work through longer thoughts in my [essays](/essays), track fragments and personal moments in my [journal](/journal), note what I’m focused on right now in [now](/now), and document the tools and objects I rely on in [uses](/uses). Outside of work I’m usually walking the city, reading, watching films, or playing basketball to clear my head. I post small moments on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/shawnyzhou).
