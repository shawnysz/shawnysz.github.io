# Shawn Zhou

I work across spaces, systems, and ideas — shifting between physical and digital projects depending on what needs to be built. I keep a record of the things I’m exploring inside my <a href="/projects">projects</a>, work through longer thoughts in my <a href="/writing">writing</a>, track the tools I rely on in <a href="/uses">what I use</a>, sketch fragments in <a href="/notes">notes</a>, and share what I’m focused on right <a href="/now">now</a>.

Outside of work I’m usually walking the city, reading, watching films, or playing basketball to clear my head. I post small moments on <a href="https://instagram.com/shawnyzhou" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
