# Shawn Zhou

I work across spaces and ideas, moving between physical and digital projects depending on what needs to be built. You can see some of my work in [projects](/projects).

My [writings](/writings) gather both longer ideas and shorter fragments as they shift over time.

I document the tools, software, and objects I rely on in [collections](/collections).

Outside of work I’m usually reading, watching films, walking in the city, or playing basketball with friends.

I share moments on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/shawnyzhou).
