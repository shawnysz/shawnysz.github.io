Hey, I'm Shawn Zhou, living in New York City.

This is my personal website for me to keep my thoughts along my life journey.

During work time, I spend most of my time with artists, architects, designers, entrepreneurs and different people on creating better spaces for people to live, work and relax. But, I don't want to label myself using some titles, me is just being me.

I enjoy reading, watching movies, listening to music, hanging out with friends, and talking about crazy ideas. 

I love watches, I love [sports](https://www.shawnyzhou.com/sports), also, I drink some good wines with my friends sometimes. 

On a random Sunday, you may see me walking in the city, or playing basketball, or playing video games at my office.

If you are interested, check out some [projects](https://shawnyzhou.com/projects) I'm working on;

And, check out my [instagram](https://instagram.com/shawnyzhou), I post stories, sometimes very frequently ;)
