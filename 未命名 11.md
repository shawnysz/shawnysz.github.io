****Getting Things Done (GTD)****

  

**Being highly productive means being able to handle multiple tasks effectively. My main strategy is utilizing what's known as the GTD system. This system helps me organize my thoughts and efficiently complete tasks. Here's an introduction to it:**

  

**The GTD approach was first introduced by David Allen, a philosopher who wrote a book titled "Getting Things Done." The methodology has since been incorporated into numerous productivity apps across various platforms, becoming a fundamental element of these tools.**

  

**I've experimented with various subsystems within GTD. One straightforward method I use involves writing down everything on my mind and crossing items off as I complete them. This process is facilitated by a system that uses symbols to prioritize tasks, with the app "Things 3" being particularly useful.**

**This app represents the third iteration and is nearly perfected. I treat it as a second brain, noting down all my thoughts and storing them. Later, when I have time, I review each item and organize them into different categories or projects. This helps me focus on tasks that are actionable and manageable.**

  

**I also use a tagging system to categorize tasks—for example, using "<15" for tasks that require less than 15 minutes and "@desk" for tasks that need to be done at a computer.**

  

**This method allows me to store various ideas and tasks under broad categories, making it easy to search and sort through different subjects.**
