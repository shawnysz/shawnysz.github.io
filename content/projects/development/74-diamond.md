# 74 Diamond

Designed, developed, and built by [**DEFiNE Development**](https://defineny.com), 74 Diamond is a ground-up residential building shaped through years of refinement, precise detailing, and a clear architectural logic elevated by an understated artistic sensibility.

The building contains six residences—three 1-Bedroom units and three 2-Bedroom duplex units—each with its own layout. Behind a mature street tree, the interiors are organized around natural light, spatial efficiency, and calm circulation. Large windows, vertical rhythms, and a warm, minimal palette create a quiet continuity throughout, with custom elements integrated as part of the architecture rather than added onto it. The façade and structural components were refined repeatedly to form a building that feels enduring and rooted in its neighborhood.

74 Diamond reflects DEFiNE’s end-to-end model: concept, design, development, coordination, and construction delivered by a single team. It embodies our way of building—intentional, disciplined, and made for the long term.
